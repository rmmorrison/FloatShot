# FloatShot

**FloatShot** is a lightweight macOS utility that lets you take one or more screenshots and pin them as floating, always-on-top windows. It's designed to help users in referencing numbers, comparing documents, or keeping visual snippets handy while they work.

## 🔮 Future Plans

**FloatShot** is the result of a weekend project I took on for a friend, and so it's not particularly "feature complete". Ideas that could (or should) be implemented in the future include:

- ⚙️ A preferences pane to customize settings (e.g., preferred screenshot key)
- 🔄 More intelligent multi-display support
- 🖼️ Better iconography and visual polish
- 🔊 Improved audio and visual feedback when screenshots are taken
- 🧩 UI enhancements for smoother interaction
